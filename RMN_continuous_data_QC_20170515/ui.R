                      records is important for conveying its key features.

                      Whether each value is marked as P, S, or F (or X if the test is not applicable to that record) depends on 
                      the input threshold values for the QC tests.

                      They are a partnership between the U.S. EPA, other federal agencies, states, tribes,
                      and local organizations.

              The progress bar does not move until after each file is completed. 
              Thus, if only one file is uploaded, the progress bar goes from 0% to 100% in one jump.
